# How to take advantage of GitHub at UTS.

GitHub Enterprise is both a [version control](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/) platform and an [automation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) platform used for [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/), [Continuous Integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) & [Continuous Delivery](https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/).

All UTS Staff can request access to GitHub by following [this process](https://uts.service-now.com/serviceconnect?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0014108). We are working on making this available for UTS Students as well. 

If you aren't familiar with git the best place to start is with the freely available [GitHub Training](https://skills.github.com/). There is further training available on A Cloud Guru, which UTS staff can request access to.

All repositories are visible to UTS staff so if you are looking for help getting started you can search and find existing template or even production repositories for your needs. 

We have enabled the [Organisation Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/uts-itd/discussions) feature to allow the Community of Practice to use the forums to ask questions and get feedback - or just to show off your latest repository. You can also share in the [DevSecOps & Cloud](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3af2a50ad3f73d4976891535418e223c88%40thread.tacv2/CoP%2520DevSecOps%2520and%2520Cloud?groupId=9489e625-6fbc-416b-9a9c-4ea9254935a0&tenantId=e8911c26-cf9f-4a9c-878e-527807be8791) Community of Practice on MS Teams.
