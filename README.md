# How to take advantage of GitHub at UTS.

GitHub Enterprise is both a [version control](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/) platform and an [automation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) platform used for [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/), [Continuous Integration](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) & [Continuous Delivery](https://minimumcd.org/minimumcd/).

If you aren't familiar with git the best place to start is with the freely available [GitHub Training](https://lab.github.com/). The recommended courses are:

 - [Introduction to Git/GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) (60m)
 - [Reviewing pull requests](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests) (30m)
 - [Managing merge conflicts](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) (26m)
 - [Security strategy essentials](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/security-strategy-essentials) (55m)
 - [Securing your workflows](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/securing-your-workflows) (20m)
 - [GitHub Actions: Hello World](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-hello-world) (36m)
 - [GitHub Actions: Continuous Integration](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-actions:-continuous-integration) (103m)
 - [Creating a Release Based Workflow](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/create-a-release-based-workflow) (65m)

All repositories are visible to UTS staff so if you are looking for help getting started you can search and find existing template or even production repositories for your needs. If nothing comes up at all a good place to ask for help is the DevSecOps & Cloud Community of Practice on MS Teams.
